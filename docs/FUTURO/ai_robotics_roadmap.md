# AI & Robotics Roadmap (IT CARGO)

## Phase 1: Foundational AI (Pro Plan Features)

1.  **AI-Powered Comex Chatbot**:
    *   Trained on Argentinian customs regulations, ITC processes, common client queries.
    *   Provides instant answers, guides users through processes.
    *   Can escalate to human agent if needed.
2.  **Automated Product Classification (HS Code Suggestion)**:
    *   User provides product description; AI suggests potential HS codes with confidence scores.
    *   Integrates with product/shipment item creation.
3.  **Intelligent Document Analysis (Future Pro/Enterprise)**:
    *   OCR and NLP to extract key data from uploaded documents (invoices, packing lists) to pre-fill forms.
    *   Basic validation checks on documents.
4.  **Enhanced Cost Estimation Calculator**:
    *   AI model to predict/estimate a wider range of costs based on historical data, routes, product types.
    *   More accurate than purely rule-based calculators.

## Phase 2: Process Automation (Pro/Enterprise Plan Features)

1.  **Automated Shipment Status Summaries & Alerts**: (As discussed)
    *   Email digests, Slack/Teams notifications.
    *   Proactive alerts for potential delays or issues based on AI predictions.
2.  **Programmable/Recurring Order Requests**:
    *   Clients can set up templates for recurring shipments.
    *   System can automatically initiate pre-alerts or draft shipment orders based on schedules.
3.  **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for ITC Internal Tasks (Future)**:
    *   Automate data entry between systems.
    *   Automate parts of customs documentation preparation.
    *   Automate compliance checks.

## Phase 3: Advanced Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics (Enterprise)

1.  **Demand Forecasting for Importers**: Based on historical data and market trends.
2.  **Route Optimization Suggestions**: For logistics.
3.  **Risk Prediction for Shipments**: Likelihood of delays, customs inspections.
4.  **Prescriptive Advice**: Suggesting optimal shipping times, carriers, or documentation strategies to minimize risk/cost.

## Considerations:
- Data requirements for training models.
- Integration points with Supabase data.
- Choice of LLMs / AI platforms.
- Cost of AI services.
