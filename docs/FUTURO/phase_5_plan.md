# Phase 5: Enterprise Plan Features & Advanced Capabilities (Revised)

This document outlines the plan for Phase 5, which will focus on developing features specific to the "Enterprise Plan," implementing advanced AI and integration capabilities, and ensuring the platform can scale for larger clients with more complex operational needs.

## Core Objectives for Phase 5:

1.  **Rollout Core "Enterprise Plan" Features:**
    *   **Custom System Integrations (API Access)**: Provide robust inbound/outbound APIs (RESTful) and webhook support for integration with client ERP, CRM, WMS, and accounting systems.
    *   **Advanced User & Permissions Management**: Granular, field-level permissions, custom role creation within a client company, and SSO integration (SAML, OAuth).
    *   **Advanced Audit Logs & Compliance Reporting**: Immutable, comprehensive audit trails and customizable compliance reports.
    *   **Support for Special Customs Regimes**: Workflows and documentation tailored for specific needs like Zonas Francas, etc.

2.  **Implement Advanced AI & Automation (Building on Phase 4):**
    *   **AI-Powered Document Analysis**: OCR and NLP to extract data from uploaded documents (invoices, packing lists) to pre-fill forms and perform validation (as per `docs/FUTURO/ai_robotics_roadmap.md`).
    *   **Predictive Analytics**: Demand forecasting for importers, route optimization suggestions, risk prediction for shipments.
    *   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for ITC Internal Tasks**: Further automate internal ITC data entry, documentation, and compliance checks.

3.  **Full-Scale Marketplace (V2/V3 from Ideation):**
    *   Enable direct client-to-client interaction (Pro/Enterprise feature).
    *   Consider advanced features like reputation systems, secure messaging, and potential integration with ITC logistics for quotes/booking.

4.  **Platform Scalability & Premium Offerings:**
    *   Options for dedicated infrastructure or higher resource limits for Enterprise clients.
    *   Guaranteed uptime SLAs.
    *   (Optional) White-labeling or custom branding.

## Technical Implementation Details & Tasks:

### 1. Enterprise Feature Implementation:
*   **API Development**: Design, implement, and document secure and versioned APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). Implement robust authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth2 client credentials) and authorization for API endpoints.
*   **Advanced Permissions System**: Extend the existing role system. This might involve creating tables like `custom_roles`, `role_permissions`, `user_custom_roles`. Logic in backend (RLS, functions) and frontend will need to be significantly enhanced.
*   **SSO Integration**: Implement handlers for SAML assertions or OAuth2 authorization code flow with Enterprise client identity providers.
*   **Audit Logging**: Ensure critical operations across the platform (especially data changes, financial transactions, user management) are logged to an immutable audit log table (e.g., `audit_trail`) with comprehensive details (who, what, when, before/after values).
*   **Special Regimes Support**: This will require deep domain analysis and potentially custom data models or workflow variations for specific customs regimes.

### 2. Advanced AI & Automation:
*   **Document Analysis Service**: Integrate with cloud AI services (e.g., Google Document AI, AWS Textract) or build/fine-tune models for extracting data from common trade documents.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine**: Develop or integrate models for forecasting. This will require significant data (historical shipment data, market data) and MLOps considerations.
*   **RPA Integration**: Utilize RPA tools or libraries to automate internal ITC tasks. This might involve scripting interactions with other systems or GUIs if APIs are not available.

### 3. Marketplace Enhancements:
*   **Direct Messaging**: Implement a secure, in-app messaging system (could use Supabase Realtime).
*   **Reputation System**: Tables for `reviews`, `ratings` linked to users/companies and marketplace transactions.
*   **Logistics Integration**: If integrating ITC logistics, API calls to internal ITC systems for quoting/booking.

### 4. Platform & Infrastructure:
*   **Scalability**: Review database indexing, query optimization, connection pooling. Consider read replicas or sharding if volume demands.
*   **Dedicated Infrastructure Setup**: If offering dedicated instances, develop provisioning scripts and management processes.
*   **SLA Monitoring**: Implement robust monitoring for uptime and performance to meet SLAs.

### 5. Backend & Database:
*   **New Tables**: `audit_trail`, `custom_roles`, `role_permissions`, `api_keys`, `sso_configurations`, `marketplace_messages`, `reviews`, potentially tables for specific customs regime data.
*   **API Versioning Strategy** for external APIs.
*   **Enhanced Security Measures**: Regular security audits, penetration testing, advanced threat detection, especially with increased API exposure.

## Testing Strategy for Phase 5:

*   Rigorous testing of API integrations with mock client systems.
*   Security testing for SSO and advanced permission models.
*   Performance and load testing for scalability.
*   Validation of AI model accuracy and reliability.
*   End-to-end testing of complex workflows involving Enterprise features.

This phase positions IT CARGO as a comprehensive, intelligent, and highly integrated platform for serious players in international trade.
